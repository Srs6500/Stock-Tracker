# StockTracker - API Keys Configuration
# 
# NOTE: StockTracker uses yfinance which does NOT require API keys!
# This file is kept for reference only. You can delete it if you want.
#
# If you plan to add features that require API keys in the future,
# you can add them here and reference them in your code.

# No API keys needed for basic functionality
# StockTracker works out of the box with yfinance!
